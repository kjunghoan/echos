## Concept Introduction

This is a small passion project that I made as a way to let people leave notes, and eventually, voice memos, pictures, or videos, in specific places to let users in those areas experience the memory, or Echos (working title), of the writer.

As a disclaimer, this repository is a proof of concept and I hope to transition a bulk of this over to a mobile application while maintaining a website to let users see the notes that they have left on a map (though this is a rough plan and I will iterate on this later when I have most of my intended features implemented)

## Getting Started

version 0.0.1
Firstly, create an env file and connect to a database:

```bash
npm run prismaDeploy
# or
yarn prismaDeploy
# or
pnpm prismaDeploy
```

Secondly, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
